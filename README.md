Hello ! This is the run-off votes counter made for the Problem Set 3 of CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course.
The user should input the key in the command prompt after the ./runoff names (names as a different names like EMMA, JOHN, etc...) command.

The software works as follows :

1 . Get the users input and checks if it's valid
2 . Asks for the numbers of voters
3 . Gets each vote
4 . Sorts the vote with a runoff
5 . Prints the winners of the election
